## RNA-Seq: Control/treatment and multivariate experiments.

Before starting, make sure to follow instructions in the [Requirements](https://github.com/ibioChile/Transcriptomics-R-Workshop-public/blob/master/Session3-Treatment_and_Multivariate/1_Requirements.md) section and download all files used in these analyses.

The [first pipeline](https://github.com/ibioChile/Transcriptomics-R-Workshop-public/blob/master/Session3-Treatment_and_Multivariate/2_Pipeline-Differential-expression-control-treatment.md) of this section focuses on analyzing RNA-seq data from a control/treatment experimental design. A step by step video can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1WDBarQF4T7G_AD0Ys-fRnBb9iEISTVsu/view?usp=sharing).

The [second pipeline](https://github.com/ibioChile/Transcriptomics-R-Workshop-public/blob/master/Session3-Treatment_and_Multivariate/3_Pipeline-Differential-expression-multivariate.md) analyzes data whith multiple variables.  A video explaining this pipeline is available [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1EdYCPAKTPI-Z28fyUF8ri1KzDw3nazgd/view).
