# RNAseq analysis in R - iBio Bioinformatic Workshop

This workshop introduces participants to RNA-seq data analysis methods, tools and file formats, using R programming language.
 
The workshop starts with a 'Basic use of R' Q&A sesion, followed by an 'R visualization' class. The second part of the workshop will focus on RNA-seq data analysis. During these sessions, participants will learn to perform differential expression analyses, using data from different RNA-seq experiment designs, including the generation of transcriptional networks.
